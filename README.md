# Kotlin Learning Journey ðŸš€

This repository documents my day-by-day progress in learning **Kotlin**. Each module (`day_1`, `day_2`, `day_3`, ...) contains the code and concepts I explored on that day.

## ðŸ“œ Structure

- **day_1**: Basics of Kotlin  
  - Variables, Data Types, and Basic Input/Output.
- **day_2**: Control Flow  
  - `if`-`else`, `when`, loops (`for`, `while`).
- **day_3**: Functions and Null Safety  
  - Writing functions, nullable types, Elvis operator.

(*This section will be updated daily as I progress.*)

2. Learn best practices for coding and documenting.
3. Push daily progress to GitHub to track consistency.
